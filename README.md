# HTTP Parser for rust

This is HTTP request/response parser written in rust. It is a directly port from [joyent/http-parser](https://github.com/joyent/http-parser).

## Status

The parser works, but it is still in very early stage. I am working on code refactor and clean. The API is unstable and may be changed significantly.
